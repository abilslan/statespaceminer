Win32 C program for statespace analysis of synchronous random Boolean network models.
Created in Dev-C++ IDE.
This was written some time before I was sold on the importance of commenting (~2012), so the code itself may be less than illuminating.

Usage:
- The program is an interactive command-line application.
- The user simply selects actions to perform to initialise and perform RNB analysis from a series of menus.
-
