Win32 C program for statespace analysis of synchronous;y updating random Boolean network models, created in Dev-C++ IDE.
This was written some time before I was sold on the importance of commenting (~2012), so the code itself may be less than illuminating. The expected use was for RBN analysis of biological pathways.

Usage:
- The program is an interactive command-line application.
- The user simply selects actions to perform to initialise and perform RNB analysis from a series of menus.
- From the main menu, choose option 1 (network menu). Initialise a network randomly or loading from file. Accepted network file formats are Pajek .net adjacency matrix representation or Cytoscape format.
- From the main menu, choose the rules menu 3 (rules menu). For simple analysis, threshold rules should be activated. These are simply: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75328354/126550619-ade7e369-33f2-41e3-afb6-925ba4ab3463.png)
